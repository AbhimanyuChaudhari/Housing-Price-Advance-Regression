# Housing Price Advance Regression

## Overview
The Housing Price Advance Regression project is aimed at predicting housing prices using advanced regression techniques. It leverages the power of Gradient Boosting along with Lasso and Ridge regularization to identify the most impactful features and achieve a high prediction accuracy.

## Key Features
- Utilizes Gradient Boosting to handle complex relationships in the data.
- Applies Lasso and Ridge regularization for feature selection and to prevent overfitting.
- Achieves an impressive accuracy of 89% in housing price prediction.

## Project Details
This project consists of:
- A Jupyter Notebook (`housing_price_regression.ipynb`) that contains the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- The `train.csv` dataset, which is used for model training and validation.
- The `test.csv` dataset, for making predictions on new data.

## Methodology
We followed these steps in the project:
1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaned the data, handled missing values, and transformed categorical variables.
2. Feature Engineering: Engineered new features and selected relevant ones.
3. Model Training: Utilized Gradient Boosting with XGBoost, along with Lasso and Ridge regression.
4. Model Evaluation: Achieved an R2 score of 0.89, indicating strong predictive power.

## How to Use
