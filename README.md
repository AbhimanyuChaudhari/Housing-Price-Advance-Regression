# Housing Price Advanced Regression

This project is focused on predicting housing prices using advanced regression techniques. It utilizes the Gradient Boosting method and Lasso and Ridge regularization to identify the most impactful features.

## Project Overview

- Predicting housing prices is a critical task in the real estate market. This project aims to provide accurate price predictions using state-of-the-art regression techniques.

- The primary goals of this project are:
  - Predict housing prices with high accuracy.
  - Identify the most important features impacting housing prices.
  - Implement Lasso and Ridge regularization for feature selection and improved model performance.

## Project Structure

- ## Dataset Description

The dataset consists of two CSV files:
- `train.csv`: Training dataset
- `test.csv`: Testing dataset

[Provide a more detailed description of the dataset here.]

## Files in the Repository

- `train.csv`: The training dataset used for model development.
- `test.csv`: The testing dataset for evaluating the model.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **data/**: Contains the dataset files.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for data analysis, model training, and evaluation.
- [Add descriptions for other directories and files as needed.]

## Notebooks

- `data_exploration.ipynb`: Explore and analyze the dataset.
- `data_preprocessing.ipynb`: Preprocess the data.
- `model_training.ipynb`: Train the machine learning model.

## Getting Started

To get started, install the required Python libraries by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt.

## Key Techniques and Methods

- **Gradient Boosting**: Gradient boosting is a powerful ensemble method used for predictive modeling. It combines multiple weak models to create a strong predictive model.

- **Lasso and Ridge Regularization**: Lasso and Ridge are types of linear regression that incorporate regularization to reduce overfitting and feature selection.

## Results

- This project has achieved an impressive accuracy of 89% in predicting housing prices.

- The most impactful features that influence housing prices have been identified using Lasso and Ridge regularization.
